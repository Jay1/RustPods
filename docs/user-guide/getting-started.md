# RustPods Deployment and Configuration Guide

## System Overview

RustPods provides enterprise-grade AirPods battery monitoring capabilities for Windows environments. This guide establishes the procedures for system deployment, configuration, and operational management.

## System Requirements

### Platform Specifications
- **Operating System**: Windows 10 (Build 1903) or later
- **Bluetooth Stack**: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 4.0+ compliant adapter
- **Supported Hardware**: Apple AirPods (all generations), Apple Beats wireless audio devices

### Hardware Prerequisites
- Active Bluetooth LE capability with Windows-certified drivers
- Minimum 50MB available disk space for application binaries
- Network connectivity for initial deployment (if downloading from repository)

## Deployment Procedures

### Binary Distribution Deployment
1. Obtain the latest release artifact from the [official repository releases](https://github.com/Jay1/RustPods/releases)
2. Extract the distribution archive to the designated deployment directory
3. Execute `RustPods.exe` to initialize the application runtime

**Note**: RustPods operates as a portable application requiring no system-level installation or registry modifications.

## Configuration and Initialization

### Initial System Configuration
Upon first execution, RustPods performs the following initialization sequence:

1. **System Tray Integration**: Application registers with the Windows system tray for persistent operation
2. **Bluetooth Stack Enumeration**: Automatic discovery and cataloging of paired Bluetooth devices
3. **Device Registry Population**: Detection and registration of compatible Apple audio devices
4. **Battery Monitoring Activation**: Initiation of real-time battery status monitoring for detected devices

### Operational Interface Access
- Access the primary interface through the system tray icon
- Device management and configuration options are available through the main application window
- Real-time battery status updates display automatically for active devices

## Device Integration Procedures

### AirPods Connectivity Configuration
1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure AirPods are properly paired through Windows Bluetooth configuration
2. **Device Discovery**: Open the RustPods main interface via system tray icon
3. **Status Verification**: Confirm device appearance in the monitored devices list
4. **Battery Monitoring**: Real-time battery levels display automatically for charging case and individual earbuds

### Operational Considerations
- Maintain AirPods case in open position or earbuds in active state for optimal battery data accuracy
- Device proximity of 10 meters or less recommended for reliable Bluetooth Low Energy communication
- Battery status updates occur at system-defined intervals to optimize power consumption

## Diagnostic and Troubleshooting

### Device Detection Issues
**Symptom**: AirPods not appearing in monitored device list

**Resolution Procedures**:
1. Verify Windows Bluetooth pairing status through system settings
2. Confirm AirPods case open state or earbud active status
3. Validate Bluetooth adapter operational status and driver integrity
4. Restart RustPods application to reinitialize device discovery
5. Access Settings interface for advanced configuration parameters

### Performance Optimization
For optimal system performance:
- Ensure Bluetooth adapter drivers are current
- Maintain clear line-of-sight between devices and Bluetooth adapter
- Monitor system resources if running concurrent Bluetooth applications

## System Administration

### Configuration Management
Advanced configuration options are accessible through the Settings interface, providing control over:
- Monitoring interval configuration
- System integration preferences  
- Battery threshold alerting parameters

### Support Resources
- **Technical Documentation**: [Complete documentation suite](../README.md)
- **Issue Reporting**: [GitHub repository issue tracking](https://github.com/Jay1/RustPods)
- **Security Considerations**: Review security policies before enterprise deployment
