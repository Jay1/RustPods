# RustPods Test Coverage Analysis

## Current Status

The project has an extensive test suite with:
- Unit tests in most modules
- Integration tests in the `tests/` directory
- UI component tests
- Mocks for Bluetooth adapters and UI components

However, we encountered compilation errors that prevent us from running the test suite and generating coverage:

1. Missing/unresolved imports in the error module:
   ```
   error[E0432]: unresolved imports `crate::error::RustPodsError`, `crate::error::ErrorSeverity`, `crate::error::ErrorStats`
   ```
2. Missing methods on the `BluetoothAdapter` struct:
   ```
   error[E0599]: no method named `get_info` found for struct `BluetoothAdapter`
   ```
3. Other type mismatch errors in detector tests

## Coverage Setup

We've set up the necessary infrastructure for coverage analysis:

1. Created `coverage.sh` (Unix) and `coverage.ps1` (Windows) scripts to:
   - Install cargo-tarpaulin if needed
   - Run the coverage tool
   - Generate HTML and JSON reports
   - Open the report automatically

2. Added GitHub Action workflow in `.github/workflows/code-coverage.yml` to:
   - Run coverage analysis on CI
   - Upload results to Codecov
   - Archive coverage reports as build artifacts

3. Added codecov.yml configuration with:
   - Overall target coverage of 75%
   - Higher targets for core components (85%)
   - Specific path configurations for different components

4. Updated testing guidelines in `.cursor/rules/testGuidelines.mdc` with:
   - Coverage targets and critical paths
   - Instructions for running and interpreting coverage reports
   - Best practices for testing different components

## Next Steps

Before we can get accurate coverage analysis:

1. Fix the compilation errors in the codebase:
   - Implement or fix the missing modules in the error handling system
   - Add the missing methods to the BluetoothAdapter struct
   - Address type mismatches in tests

2. Run the tests incrementally:
   - Start with unit tests in individual modules
   - Move to integration tests
   - Finally, run the full test suite

3. Once tests are passing, run coverage analysis:
   ```
   cargo tarpaulin --verbose --workspace --out Html --output-dir ./coverage
   ```

4. Address coverage gaps:
   - Focus on critical paths identified in the test guidelines
   - Add tests for areas with low coverage
   - Consider implementing more robust mocks for external dependencies

## Documentation

- All testing guidelines are documented in `.cursor/rules/testGuidelines.mdc`
- Manual testing procedures are in `docs/development/manual-testing-guide.md`
- GitHub issue templates include a specific format for manual testing issues
- Test mocks and utilities are available in `tests/bluetooth/mocks.rs` and `tests/test_helpers.rs`
