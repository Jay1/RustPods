# RustPods Project Memory

This file stores project-specific knowledge, conventions, and user preferences learned during the development of the RustPods application.

## Project Structure

- **Main Module Organization**: The application is organized into several key modules:
  - `bluetooth`: For Bluetooth scanning and device management
  - `airpods`: For AirPods-specific detection and data parsing
  - `ui`: For Iced GUI components and rendering
  - `app`: For core application state management
  - `config`: For configuration handling
  - `error`: For error type definitions

- **Command-line Interface**: The application offers multiple running modes via command-line arguments:
  - `adapters`: List available Bluetooth adapters
  - `scan`: Run a basic Bluetooth scan
  - `interval`: Run interval-based scanning
  - `airpods`: Run AirPods filtering demo
  - `events`: Run event system demo
  - `ui`: Launch the GUI application

## Technical Decisions

- **Bluetooth Library**: Using `btleplug` v0.10 for cross-platform Bluetooth LE support
- **Async Runtime**: Using `tokio` with full features for asynchronous operations
- **UI Framework**: Using `iced` v0.10 with tokio and debug features for GUI implementation
- **Error Handling**: Using `thiserror` for error type definitions
- **System Tray**: Using `tray-item` v0.7 for system tray integration
- **UI Theme**: Using Catppuccin Mocha color scheme for a visually appealing dark theme

## Implementation Patterns

- **Bluetooth Scanning**: 
  - `BleScanner` implements scan operations and device discovery
  - Scanning uses a subscription model where components can subscribe to specific events
  - Filters are used to narrow down events to specific types or devices

- **AirPods Detection**:
  - Apple devices are identified by manufacturer data
  - `AirPodsFilter` provides various filters for specific AirPods models
  - Battery information is extracted from manufacturer data
  - Battery levels are normalized to percentages (0-100%)

- **Event System**:
  - The application uses an event system for Bluetooth events
  - Components can subscribe to specific event types
  - Events include device discovery, device updates, battery updates, etc.

- **UI Architecture**:
  - The UI uses Iced's `Application` pattern for state management
  - `AppState` manages the application state and is passed to UI components
  - UI components are organized into modules in the `ui` directory
  - The UI is launched by the `run_ui` function in `ui/app.rs`

- **Theme Implementation**:
  - Theme is defined in the `ui/theme.rs` module
  - Color constants are defined using `Color::from_rgb8()` with Catppuccin Mocha hex values
  - Theme enum with `CatppuccinMocha` variant is implemented
  - StyleSheet traits are implemented for application, button, container, and text_input
  - Theme is applied through the `theme()` method in the `Application` implementation

## Known Issues & Workarounds

- **Event System Integration**: The subscription model requires proper cleanup to avoid memory leaks
- **UI Launch**: The UI must be launched with the `ui` command or it will default to the CLI mode

## Future Improvements

- Implement battery status monitoring and updates
- Add error handling for Bluetooth connection issues
- Enhance system tray functionality
- Improve UI with battery status display
- Create settings UI for configuration options
- Add additional theme variants (like Catppuccin Latte for light mode)
