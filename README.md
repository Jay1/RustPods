# RustPods

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ This little project came about because I wanted a simple, no-fuss way to check my AirPods battery on Windows. I found that many existing tools were either a bit complicated to set up, weren't free, or just didn't quite fit what I needed.

So, I built this: an open-source application crafted with Rust ðŸ¦€, designed to monitor Apple AirPods (and hopefully other Bluetooth headphones too!) easily and reliably.

## Project Overview

RustPods is designed to provide a cross-platform desktop application that:
- Displays real-time status of connected AirPods/Bluetooth headphones
- Monitors battery levels for AirPods devices
- Provides system tray integration for easy access
- Detects AirPods devices using Bluetooth Low Energy scanning
- Offers a configurable settings interface

## Setup

1. Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed. See https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
2. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/RustPods.git
   cd RustPods
   ```
3. The project uses the following dependencies (already configured in `Cargo.toml`):
   - btleplug - Bluetooth Low Energy library
   - iced - Modern GUI library for Rust (Catppuccin Mocha theme)
   - tokio - Async runtime
   - thiserror - Error handling
   - async-stream - Async stream utilities
4. Build the project:
   ```sh
   cargo build
   ```

## Usage

- Run the application:
  ```sh
  cargo run
  ```
- The application will initialize the system tray icon
- Use the system tray menu to:
  - Start/stop Bluetooth scanning
  - Open the main application window
  - Access settings for customization
  - Exit the application

## Project Structure

    - `theme.rs` - UI theming (Catppuccin Mocha)
    - `components/` - Reusable UI components
  - `error.rs` - Error handling utilities

## Event System

The project implements a flexible event system for handling Bluetooth device events:
- `EventBroker` manages subscribers and distributes events
- `EventFilter` allows for filtering events by type, device, or custom criteria
- Subscribers can receive only the events they're interested in

## AirPods Detection

RustPods can detect various AirPods models:
- AirPods (1st and 2nd generation)
- AirPods Pro (1st and 2nd generation)
- AirPods 3
- AirPods Max

The detection system decodes manufacturer data from BLE advertisements to extract:
- Device type identification
- Battery levels for left, right, and case
- Charging status

## UI Implementation

This project uses iced for the user interface with the Catppuccin Mocha theme. Key aspects of our implementation:

- **Declarative UI**: The interface is built by composing widgets in a functional, declarative style
- **Message-based Architecture**: All UI state changes are driven by messages processed in the update function
- **System Tray Integration**: A non-intrusive system tray icon provides access to application functions
- **Settings Window**: A tabbed interface for configuring Bluetooth, Interface, and System settings
- **Theming**: Consistent application of the Catppuccin Mocha theme across all components

Our implementation follows the patterns documented in our [icedPatterns.mdc](.cursor/rules/icedPatterns.mdc) file.

## Development Status

The project has implemented:
- Bluetooth device scanning and discovery
- AirPods device detection and identification
- Event broker system for Bluetooth events
- UI with main and settings windows
- System tray integration
- Configuration persistence

Active development continues with a focus on:
- Improving UI functionality
- Enhancing AirPods detection reliability
- Adding support for more Bluetooth headphone types
- Cross-platform testing and optimization
