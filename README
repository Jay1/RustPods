# RustPods

**Display Apple AirPods battery levels on your Windows desktop, built with Rust.**

RustPods aims to be a lightweight, efficient, and native Windows application for monitoring the battery status of your Apple AirPods (left, right, and charging case).

**Current Status: Pre-Alpha / In Development**
This project is currently in the early stages of development. Functionality is not yet complete.

## Features (Target for V1.0)

*   **AirPods Detection:** Automatically scans for and identifies nearby Apple AirPods.
*   **Battery Monitoring:**
    *   Displays battery levels for the Left AirPod.
    *   Displays battery levels for the Right AirPod.
    *   Displays battery levels for the Charging Case.
*   **Real-time Updates:** Battery information is updated dynamically.
*   **Simple User Interface:**
    *   A clean, non-intrusive window showing battery percentages and/or visual indicators.
    *   Connection status display.
*   **System Tray Integration:**
    *   Application icon in the Windows system tray.
    *   Tooltip on hover showing summarized battery levels.
    *   Context menu for showing/hiding the main window and exiting the application.
*   **Settings:**
    *   Option to launch the application on Windows startup.
    *   Configuration persistence.

## Planned Features (Post V1.0)

*   Support for other Bluetooth headphones/earbuds.
*   Customizable UI themes (e.g., Light/Dark mode).
*   Notifications for low battery levels.
*   Displaying AirPods model/firmware version.
*   And more!

## Prerequisites

*   Windows 10 or Windows 11.
*   A Bluetooth adapter compatible with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
*   Rust toolchain (for building from source).

## Building from Source (General Outline)

Detailed build instructions will be provided as the project matures. The general steps will involve:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd RustPods
    ```
2.  **Install Rust:** If you don't have it, install Rust from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).
3.  **Build the project:**
    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```
    The executable will be found in `target/release/`.

## Usage (Once Built)

1.  Ensure your Bluetooth is enabled on Windows.
2.  Connect your AirPods to your Windows machine as you normally would.
3.  Run the `RustPods.exe` executable.
4.  The application window should appear, or an icon will be visible in the system tray.
